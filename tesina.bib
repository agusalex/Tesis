  abstract={Wireless embedded devices, especially those of the open source hardware/software kind have seen rapid growth in recent years. This kind of devices when combined with ad hoc networks and sensor data can be a low-cost and highly scalable solution to many applications. In this paper we describe the experience of taking this concept of network infrastructure, developing application infrastructure and applying it, as a prototype, to a practical situation for a medium-sized city in the Buenos Aires province outer area, Argentina. We implement a novel sensor data delivery platform using open source hardware and software focused on streetlight maintenance at a fraction of the commercial implementation costs. To the extent of our knowledge this is the first system developed, deployed and documented in a Latin American country. Also presented in this paper is the system architecture as well as the design of hardware and software components as well as the results obtained.}}

    abstract = { We present a detailed study on the RSS-based location techniques in wireless sensor networks (WSN). There are two aspects in this paper. On the one hand, the accurate RSSI received from nodes is the premise of accurate location. Firstly, the distribution trend of RSSI is analyzed in this experiment and determined the loss model of signal propagation by processing experimental data. Secondly, in order to determine the distance between receiving nodes and sending nodes, Gaussian fitting is used to process specific RSSI at different distance. Moreover, the piecewise linear interpolation is introduced to calculate the distance of any RSSI. On the other hand, firstly, the RSSI vector similarity degree (R-VSD) is used to choose anchor nodes. Secondly, we designed a new localization algorithm which is based on the quadrilateral location unit by using more accurate RSSI and range. Particularly, there are two localization mechanisms in our study. In addition, the generalized inverse is introduced to solve the coordinates of nodes. At last, location error of the new algorithm is about 17.6\% by simulation experiment. }
